Bug reports:
 Please include enough information for the maintainers to reproduce the
 problem. Generally speaking, that means:
- the contents of any input files necessary to reproduce the bug
  and command line invocations of the program(s) involved (crucial!).
- a description of the problem and any samples of the erroneous output.
- the version number of the program(s) involved (use --version).
- hardware, operating system, and compiler versions (uname -a).
- unusual options you gave to configure, if any (see config.mak).
- anything else that you think would be helpful.

See README-dev for information on the development environment -- any
interested parties are welcome. If you're a programmer and wish to
contribute, this should get you started. If you're not a programmer,
your help in writing test cases, checking documentation against the
implementation, etc., would still be very much appreciated.

GCK hello is free software. See the file COPYING for copying conditions.

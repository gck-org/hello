Basic Installation
==================

   Briefly, the shell command `./configure && make && make install` should
configure, build, and install this package. The following more-detailed
instruction are generic; see the `README` file for instructions specific to
this package.

   The `configure` shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation. It uses
those values within a `Makefile` to build for that POSIX system as
defined by `config.mak` which was generated by `configure`.

Compilers and Options
=====================

  Some systems require unusal options for compilation or linking that
the `configure` script does not know about. If you run into an issue
run `./configure --help` to figure out what you can do to fix the
behavoir.

Installation Names
==================

  By default, `make install` installs the package's command under
`/usr/local/bin`. You can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local/`
by giving `configure` the option `--prefix=PREFIX` to `configure`, the package uses
PREFIX as the prefix for installation programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files still use the regular prefix.

`configure` Invokation
======================

  `configure` recongizes the following options to control its operations.

  `--help`
     Prints a summary of all the options to `configure`, and exits.
  `--prefix=PREFIX`
     Sets the installation prefix.
  `CFLAGS`
    Sets the flags used during compilation.

`configure` also accepts some other options. Run `configure --help` for more
details
